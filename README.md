This intention of this project is to help to get into OpenRewrite usage and developement.

It is recommended to go through the submodules in this order:

- recipe-demo
  - execute recipes and examine the results
- print-lst
  - take a closer look at the lossless syntax tree of the OpenRewrite Java
- create-recipe
  - implement a recipe yourself and make the test work
